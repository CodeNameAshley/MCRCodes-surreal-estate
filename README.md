# üè† Surreal Estate üè†

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is a property finder and selling application utilising backend created by Manchester codes!
The theme of the app revolves around the word Surreal, the theme and design uses cottage core tones and images from ACNH.
The app allows the user to input their property, starting with a title, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, a dropdown box for type of property, and location. 
Once submitted the data is posted to an API endpoint, it is retrieved using react hook, in the landing page.
The landing page shows each property available, as well as different searching filters.

Filtering is available by location and price asc-desc. Add property, allows users to add properties via a form. 
Once the property is added a box will notify the users that their property have succesfully been placed in the API, an error message will also appear if not succesful. 
On clicking the submit button, the form refreshes ready for the next property to be added. 

## Design üñºÔ∏è

The UI of this project is bold but not overpowering. 
The components are laid out for the users ease, the logo and navigation at the top, a banner image, a toggle filter button, then the list of properties. 
The list of filters have been placed in a toggle button to not take up space in the screen, this was achieved using useState. 
The colours compliment each other, and the images are from ACNH cottage core island creators to depict the theme of 'surreal'.
